Discouragement generally occurs when our
expectations (what we think should happen) 
don¡¯t align with reality
(what actually happens). In many 
cases our expectations 
are unrealistic, and this 
often has to do with how long we think 
things should happen. 
If we take a longer view, 
and relax our expectations 
a little, it can really 
help to decrease discouragement.
The reality is that most 
things that are worthwhile 
take a lot of effort 
and time to come to fruition.
